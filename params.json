The vimeo video covered up most of the bugs, unstableness and dirtiness underneath. It also missed quite some beautiful details of the original iOS app.\r\n\r\nSo for this version, by adding a lot more visual/motion details and multi-touch gestures, the purpose is mostly challenging my own technical limits. Besides, I really enjoy having something I can slowly polish without having to worry about deadlines.\r\n\r\n## Build Dependency\r\n\r\nNode.js and UglifyJS","note":"Don't delete this file!
